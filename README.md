# Databricks Billing

![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/charliewei0716/databricks-billing?style=social)

This is a web application that integrates a [Databricks Dashboard](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/dashboards/) with a [Mosaic AI Agent](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/tutorials/agent-framework-notebook) chat interface. The billing dashboard serves as the main display, and it is generated using [Databricks System Tables](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/system-tables/) and cloud infrastructure cost data as its sources. Additionally, a multi-agent assistant, built with [Databricks Genie](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/genie/) and [RAG](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation), enables users to ask any questions about the dashboard in natural language and receive responses.
